## Test Environment

The performance tests were conducted in a controlled environment to ensure accuracy and consistency in the results. The environment setup includes the following components:

### Network Configuration

- Network: Polygon Edge
- Consensus Algorithm: PolyBFT (v1.0-rc1)

### Instance Types

The tests utilized various Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance types to evaluate the impact of varying compute resources on network performance:

- **t2.xlarge**
- **t2.micro**
- **c5.2xlarge**
- **c6a.48xlarge**
- **x2iezn.2xlarge**
- **c6a.xlarge**

### Transaction Types

The tests were performed using three different types of transactions to assess the network's capability to handle various use cases:

- **EOA to EOA**: Representing simple value transfers between user accounts.
- **ERC20**: Token transfers, simulating the exchange of tokens on the network.
- **ERC721**: Non-fungible token (NFT) transfers representing the exchange of unique digital assets.

### Performance Metrics

The following key performance metrics were considered during the tests:

- **Transactions per second (TPS) sent**: The number of transactions submitted to the network per second.
- **Transactions per second (TPS) mined**: The number of transactions successfully processed and included in the blockchain per second.
- **Gas per transaction**: The amount of gas consumed by each transaction, representing the computational cost.
- **Gas per second**: The total amount consumed per second indicates the network's overall computational capacity.
