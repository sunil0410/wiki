Mapping is necessary in order to transfer your assets to and from Ethereum and Polygon PoS. We offer two bridges to do the same. More details on the bridge can be understood [here](/pos/design/bridge/ethereum-polygon/getting-started.md).

:::info

The Polygon PoS bridge is available for both Polygon Mainnet as well as Mumbai Testnet.

## Steps to submit a mapping request

In order to map tokens between Ethereum and Polygon PoS, you may use the [Polygon Token Mapper](https://mapper.polygon.technology/). Open the link and click on the **Map New Token** button on the top right corner to initiate a new mapping request.

**Step 1 &rarr;** Choose the network on which you want to map your token. You may choose **Goerli-Mumbai** for Testnet, and **Ethereum-Polygon PoS** for the Mainnet.

**Step 2 &rarr;** Select the type of token you are mapping - **ERC20**, **ERC721**, or **ERC1155**.

**Step 2 &rarr;** Enter your **Ethereum/Goerli** token address in the  ** Root Contract Address (L1)**  field. Make sure your token contract code has been verified on the **Ethereum/Goerli** blockchain explorers.

**Step 4 &rarr;** After adding the Select the type of token you are mapping - **ERC20**, **ERC721**, or **ERC1155**.

**Step 5 &rarr;** Now, click on the **Submit** button to initiate the mapping process. Our team will review the mapping request and get back to you in 7 days.


For a successful Mainnet mapping, you may provide your token details [here](https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-token-list/issues/new/choose) to be added on the [**Polygon Token List**](https://api-polygon-tokens.polygon.technology/tokenlists/polygonTokens.tokenlist.json).
